If you've ever wondered what I'm using be it software, hardware, fonts, etc. then
this page is dedicated for that ðŸ˜‰ Based on [uses.tech](https://uses.tech)

## Hardware

- MacBook Pro M1 (16-inch, 2021). Previously MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2017)
- Logitech M585. Previously Logitech M337. I don't need a _fancy_ mouse as I have a keyboard centric
  workflow
- iPhone 11 & Samsung Galaxy S20+


## Software (Desktop Apps and CLI tools)

- **(neo)vim** -- Currently my main `$EDITOR`.
- **tmux** -- a terminal multiplexer. I use it together with `(neo)vim`. Makes seamless switching
              from one project to another.
- **fish** -- a **f**riendly **i**interactive **sh**ell. My current `$SHELL`.
- **ripgrep** -- better replacement for `grep`. Also written in `Rust`.
- **fzf** -- an awesome fuzzy finder written in `Go`!
- **fd** -- a faster alternative to `find`. I also use it together with `fzf`.
- **eza** -- a modern _(?)_ replacement for `ls`. It's been pretty good so far
- **bat** -- a `cat` clone that supports syntax highlighting. I also use it in combination with
             `fzf`.
- **mise** -- my go to tool for managing multiple versions of languages  I use.
- **universal-ctags** -- for generating `tags` file when working on projects. Pretty fast
- **kitty** -- Previously used `alacritty` and `iTerm2`
- **raycast** -- can't say it's better than [Alfred]() but it's _free_ and I've been happily using it!
                 I also use this as a replacement for [rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com/)
- **bitwarden** -- an open source password manager. I think I started using pw managers around
                _October 2019_.
- **kap** -- a screen recorder. I usually use it for recording GIFs when reporting issues to
             open-source projects.
- **keycastr** -- displays pressed keys on screen. I use it when I do live demos
                  (which I haven't done so far. LOL!)
- **karabiner-elements** -- for remapping <kbd>Caps Lock</kbd> to <kbd>Esc</kbd> when pressed alone
                            and <kbd>Control</kbd> when pressed with other keys. Pretty neat!
- **brew** -- awesome package manager that I use to install for the above packages.

## Others

- I use Microsoft Edge because of the vertical tabs! Previously used `Google Chrome` and `Firefox`
- I am currently using `SauceCodePro Nerd Font Mono` for my font.
- My go to colorscheme is [Catppuccin](https://catppuccin.com/). Previously used _kanagawa_ and _One
  Dark_
- For `browser extensions` I use:
  - uBlock Origin
  - Bitwarden
  - Grammarly
  - Vimium -- for `vim` keybindings while browsing
  - wasavi -- for converting text areas into vim
  - Visbug -- pretty neat tool for frontend development

You can also check out some of my configurations (init.lua, .tmux.conf, etc.) in my
