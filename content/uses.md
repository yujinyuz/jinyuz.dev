title: "Uses"
---

If you've ever wondered what I'm using be it software, hardware, fonts, etc. then
this page is dedicated for that üòâ Based on [uses.tech](https://uses.tech)

## Hardware

- MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2017, Two Thunderbolt 3 ports)
- Logitech M337 mouse (when I feel like I want to use a mouse)
- Redmi Note 7


## Software (Desktop Apps and CLI tools)

- **(neo)vim** -- a fork of `vim`. Currently my main `$EDITOR`.
- **tmux** -- a terminal multiplexer. I use it together with `(neo)vim`. Makes seamless switching from one project to another.
- **tmuxinator** -- manages my `tmux` sessions. Kinda like workspaces
- **fish** -- a **f**riendly **i**interactive **sh**ell. My current `$SHELL` (previously `zsh`).
- **ripgrep** -- better replacement for `grep`. Also written in `Rust`.
- **fzf** -- an awesome fuzzy finder written in `Go`!
- **exa** -- a modern (?) replacement for `ls`. It's been pretty good so far
- **bat** -- a `cat` clone that supports syntax highlighting. I also use it in combination with `fzf`.
- **fd** -- a faster alternative to `find`. I also use it together with `fzf`.
- **diff-so-fancy** -- provides better output when doing a `git diff`!
- **pyenv**, **rbenv**, **goenv**, **nvm** -- for managing multiple versions of `python`, `ruby`, `go`, and `node` respectively.
- **universal-ctags** -- for generating `tags` file when working on projects. Pretty fast
- **grip** -- a GitHub markdown previewer
- **alacritty** -- an ultra fast terminal written in `Rust`. My current terminal (previously `iTerm2`).
- **alfred** -- a better spotlight alternative. Though I haven't purchased the pro version yet. But I like its UI, so yeah
- **bitwarden** -- an open source password manager. I think I started using pw managers around October 2019.
- **kap** -- a screen recorder. I usually use it for recording GIFs when reporting issues to open-source projects.
- **keycastr** -- displays pressed keys on screen. I use it when I do live demos (which I haven't done so far. LOL!)
- **rectangle** -- for organizing windows. Pretty sleek since I just need to press `‚åò‚åÉ‚Üê` to move current window to the left, etc.
- **joplin** -- for writing random thoughts. I also used it as a habit tracker.
- **lulu** -- for blocking unknown or unwanted outgoing connections. It's pretty helpful since it notifies me which apps needs to connect to the web.
- **karabiner-elements** -- for remapping `caps lock` to `Escape` when pressed alone and `Control` when pressed with other keys. Pretty neat!
- **brew** -- awesome package manager that I use to install for the above packages.

## Others

- I use `Google Chrome` as my main browser though I'm switching to `Firefox` from time to time.
- I am currently using `FiraMono Nerd Font Mono` font style.
- For `chrome extensions` I use:
  - uBlock Origin
  - Bitwarden Chrome Plugin
  - Grammarly
  - Surfingkeys -- for `vim` keybindings while browsing
  - Visbug -- pretty neat tool for frontend development
  - Octotree -- useful when browsing files in GitHub repositories
