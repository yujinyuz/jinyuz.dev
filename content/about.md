I love to write clean and readable code. When developing software,
I go by the quote:

> "Make it work, make it right, make it fast."

Currently, I am familiar and comfortable with working in these languages
and frameworks for scripting and web development:

- HTML5 and CSS3
- ECMAScript aka Javascript
  - ReactJS
  - GatsbyJS
- Python
  - Django
  - Flask
- Ruby
  - Ruby on Rails
- Shell
- [Other tools under my belt](/uses)

I try to be language agnostic as much as possible. Languages and frameworks are just
tools to achieve a goal and it doesn't define one's capabilities. It's about choosing
the right tools for the right job that makes you a better developer!
