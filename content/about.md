I love to write clean and readable code. When developing software, I go by the quote:

> Make it work, make it right, make it fast.<br>
> -- <cite>Kent Beck</cite>

I'm currently developing web applications with `Python` and `Django`. I am mostly working on the
backend so I heavily use `Django REST Framework`, though I've also used `FastAPI` and `Flask`.

I haven't been a fan of _modern_ frontend but I do know how to work with them. But if I'm asked of
my preference, I'd choose a boring tech like [htmx](https://htmx.org).

I try to be language agnostic as much as possible. Languages and frameworks are just tools to
achieve a goal and it doesn't define one's capabilities.

It's about choosing the right tools for the right job that makes you a better developer!
