I love to write clean and readable code. When developing software,
I go by the quote:

Currently, I am familiar working with these languages/frameworks for scripting and web development:

- HTML5 and CSS3
- ECMAScript aka Javascript
  - ReactJS
  - GatsbyJS
- Python
  - Django
  - Flask
- Ruby
  - Ruby on Rails
- Shell

Other tools under my belt:

- (neo)vim -- my main `$EDITOR`.
- fish -- my current `$SHELL` (preivously `zsh`).
- alacritty -- my current terminal (previously `iTerm2`).
- ripgrep -- better replacement for `grep`.
- fzf -- an awesome fuzzy finder!

I try to be language agnostic as much as possible. I believe that those languages
and frameworks are just tools to achieve a goal and shouldn't be a basis
of ones capabilities.
