## Brain Fog

I feel like I have not been performing at my best in the past _6 months_~ or so. It might have to do
with the habits I've built when I stopped meditating.

I recently saw a post that in order to combat _brain fog_, you can try using your non-dominant hand
for simple tasks such as brushing your teeth, writing with a pen, or using it with a mouse.

I've done all of those in when I first started to learn about them and I think it did pretty since I
felt proud and confident. But old habits never die and I've shied away from doing those things.

As soon as I encountered the post, I immediately switched my mouse to the left side of my table. But
one thing that bothered me with my current mouse[^1] was that it wasn't designed to be used for left
hand.

I've been contemplating for awhile of buying an [Apple Magic Mouse 2](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MK2E3AM/A/magic-mouse-white-multi-touch-surface)
but there has been a love and hate relationship with that mouse. I went to an Apple Store last
weekend just to see if it would suit my taste since it has a simple design and can be used by either
the left or right hand.


It was on a _50% discount_ when I got there and so as the [Apple Magic Trackpad](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MK2D3AM/A/magic-trackpad-white-multi-touch-surface),
they didn't have
a display item for the _trackpad_ but I already own a MacBook so I know it's of good quality. Went
to the internet and searched for reviews and I immediately bought it.

The deciding factor was that I already have a _mouse_ and thought that I don't need a fancy one
since I have a keyboard centric workflow. Plus the trackpad just stays where it is and I don't have
to move it around. I do have a small workspace so I guess that was a great deal considering that it
was also on a _50% discount_.

As of writing this, I've been using it for about a day now and so far it's great. I now have the
same gestures as my Mac's trackpad. The only caveat as was that it was missing a _middle click_
which I heavily use with my mouse, particularly for opening links and closing tabs in a browser.

Luckily, there's an [application](https://github.com/artginzburg/MiddleClick-Sonoma) for this and
all I have to do is to tap the trackpad with 3 fingers. You can also use 3 finger click but the  3
finger tap is what I've configured it to be at the moment. I might change it though.

Anyway, loving the new trackpad!

## Logs

I've been labeling myself as a _terminerd_[^2] and one thing I changed within my website is that I
converted the links from `weekly-journal` -> `logs` and added a `journalctl` header when you access
[/logs](/logs).

Writing this weekly logs helps me improve my writing skills and indirectly my speaking skills. I've
been watching ThePrimeagen lately and one of the things he mentioned kind of stuck to me.

That if you consume a lot of short content, then your brain will be optimized for consuming a lot of
short contents. I'm on social media almost _every day_ and I've just been _doom scrolling_ and I
think that kind of affected my brain.

It even got to a point where I think I have ADHD since I can relate to most of its symptoms. At
least that's what I think.

But anyway, I've been reading a manga called _Wind Breaker_ and in one of the chapters, _Hajime
Umemiya_ mentions about how he became a leader. Not because he wanted to, but because he needed to
be a leader in order to achieve his goals.

That made me think about what I want in life. The end goal is probably to enjoy life to the fullest
without having worries, and I really need to think of a _business_ or a way to be able to achieve
what I want.

I never actually thought of becoming a business owner when I was a kid, but I guess I need to be one
in order to reach my goals. I need to engineer[^3] something that could at least change the lives of
those around me.

I guess I'll have to find out myself on what would that be!

## Stroll

It's been a long time since I went to a mall and a lot of things has changed. I get to see what it's
like being outside and sometimes you just get the best ideas while roaming around.

I always ride my folding bicycle whenever I want to go to places around the city. The transportation
situation here in the Philippines is a nightmare. And I don't want to deal with the traffic as well.

I don't have much to say about this topic anymore, my mind has been wandering around off of its own.
Probably I chose a boring topic or a topic that I have less things to say about.

It's always been like this. I started recreating our capstone project but I have put it off since
then and haven't touched it in weeks. I'll probably go back to it once I sort things out but for
now, I kind of lost interest in completing it.


Until then ~


[^1]: Logitech M337
[^2]: a person who loves the classic terminal
[^3]: I just saw this simple definition about Engineering.
      It is defined as any human creation that makes a job easier. And I guess I would now have the
      confidence to call myself a _Software Engineer_ even though it can be used interchangeably
      with _Software Developer_ but the former is music to my ears so I'll be using that onward.
