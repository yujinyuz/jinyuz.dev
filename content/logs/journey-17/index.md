## Realizations

I just realized what I wanted to work on the most. Stuffs like developer tools, cli applications, or
probably anything that is close to the developer.

I've been a user of those tools, and made some tools myself such as gitpad. Though that one was just
specific for neovim.


I probably still want to do some web development work but I guess what I want to work on longer is
devtools.
