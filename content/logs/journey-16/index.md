## Void


Can't remember what happened during this week. Putting things off kinda sucks. Based on last week's
log, I'm just finishing things off from my talk about meta programming in python.

I just named this Void, using the reference in One Piece where there were 100 years of history
missing.


If my memory serves me right, this was also the week in which we were supposed to have a family
reunion.

I didn't go coz I wasn't in the mood, and I had other things to do.
