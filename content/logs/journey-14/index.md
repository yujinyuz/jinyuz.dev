## Graduation

Had a lot of events that happened this week. My father just graduated from his PhD in Political
Administration and my younger sister graduated in Bachelor of Science in Pharmacy.


Parents came to visit last Tuesday, and we went out to eat at a buffet. I had an annoying errand to
look for a buffet, and we ended up eating somewhere that was readily available.

The food was just so-so, and only had 4 variety and costed us around P8500. I guess it was worth it
since the famous _Vikings_ has already been fully booked that day, and it was just near the venue.


## Break

I sent a notice to my boss that I'll be leaving for a week because my father and sister is
graduating, and I didn't want any kinds of distractions. I did mention that I'll try to work but
that didn't happen.


I really wanted to take a week off ever since the start of the month, but things kept dragging on to
the point that my supposed leave was postponed.


As of now, I want to extend it for another week. I still have a pending task that I had been working
on for a couple of weeks now. I haven't made that much progress. I do know what the outcome should
behave and look like but for some reason, I keep on delaying it on purpose. Is it ADHD?


## Mindanao Summit


Had some learnings which I wasn't quite expecting....


Got to talk to students, and they shared some interesting perspective.
They noticed that I had been consistently attending to meet ups. They are quite thankful for that
since at least there is one _expert_ in the field that is interested to go, and that they could
network to.

Had I not been there, they would probably find it less exciting since most of them are just
students that share the same passion, but I guess that wouldn't help them moving forward since they
prefer learning from the _old_ folks
