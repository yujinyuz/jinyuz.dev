## Slowing Down


It's now coming to a point where I don't know what I want to do with my life. I want to keep on
writing my thoughts, or at least what has happened during the week, but I'm slowly losing interest.

This week, I extended my leave up to Wednesday just because I didn't feel like working on Monday and
Tuesday.

I was kinda finishing a presentation for my talk related to Python metaprogramming. That got me
interested in about a day or two, but it mellowed down after I submitted it.

I went live on twitch last Saturday, and I wasn't expecting any viewers at all. My stream got
raided, but with only around ~4 viewers, but hey, it was awesome.

I didn't have my microphone turned on coz I didn't know that people would be watching, and I also
didn't know how to interact with them when I'm only on a single monitor.

I spent a few hours improving my streaming setup by adding a twitch chat overlay. Now, I could reply
to chat via OBS with a twitch dock, and their messages would appear at the right side of the stream.
Pretty cool, huh?

Aside from that, not much has happened this week. Though, I was supposed to attend a family reunion,
but that got cancelled. It was replaced with a mini reunion, but I didn't feel like coming.

I haven't even published last week's journal coz I was too lazy to even finish what I was writing
about.

It was around the DevCon Mindanao Summit 2024, and I guess I didn't have much take aways to it.


Oh, and for dinner, we ordered dumplings from a local Chinese Restaurant. An unexpected thing has
happened, which might lead me to not ordering at that restaurant again. There was a cockroach in one
of the containers of the dumplings. It was a good thing that my sister saw it and that I got a
refund.

I feel sorry for the restaurant, but I won't be ordering from them again. At least for now.


PS: To my future self. You probably noticed that I'm not following the 3-topic rule you've applied
to yourself when writing about your week. I'm just not in the right mental state of doing that. So,
I hope you are at a place where you're at peace :)
