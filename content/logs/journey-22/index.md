## Highlights

* Had a meeting with one of the clients at my current job, and it horrendously failed. Well, we were
  expecting it to fail at some point since it was still in beta, but it failed at the first attempt
  because of the number of characters.
* Changed from presenterm to sli.dev for my talk. It didn't have a code runner, but I just improvised
  and moved on. Good thing I had a back up ready as I didn't want to mess up my first ever public
  talk. sli.dev did a good job at making my presentation more interactive and had everything I
  needed.
* Delivered my first ever talk, and I could say it was a success. I know that there are still things
  that could be improved. I haven't got the video recording yet, but I'll probably watch it at some
  point. It was surprising to me since I wasn't that nervous. I guess I was just prepared, but I
  didn't get to answer some questions properly. I'll work on impromptu next.
* Got to connect with new people, and I now know a ruby dev!
* Got to learn some GitHub actions and published my talk.
* Still thinking about whether I should submit a talk about navigating a codebase in python as a
  lightning talk for PyCon. I wonder how it would be beneficial though
