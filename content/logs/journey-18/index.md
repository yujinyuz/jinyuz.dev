## Distractions

Lately, I've been getting distracted more and more. I've been comparing myself to others, a lot.

I really need to go back into writing, reading, and meditating. I feel that I'd end up wanting to
have another week or 2 for a vacation.

I attended a community meetup for AWS today, and the topics were interesting since it was related to
RAGs and machine learning. Got to meet some old acquaintances as well.

I wasn't able to attend the 3rd meetup for DurianPy.

Went to the movies on last Saturday and watched Deadpool and Wolverine.

Worked on `ihap` project, which is basically a simpler implementation of the countapi. I hope I get
this into production

Went live on Twitch and met an internet stranger complimenting my stream setup.

Went with my SO on Sunday for her last (?) flea market for this year.
