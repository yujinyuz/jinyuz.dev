## Unfinished

I had been shutdown for around 3-4 days since I had a fatigue. I guess that's the result of sleeping
2:00 in the morning for consecutive weeks.

I've been procrastinating on my work lately. I just watched another video where it says that you
aren't lazy, things are just boring. And that's probably right. Things have been getting quite
boring lately to the point where I don't even have the motivation to finish it.

Some people said it's an ADHD thing where if you could picture yourself getting a task completed,
then you'd end up not completing it. I don't know how true that is, but I sometimes feel the same
thing.

When things are either too easy or too hard, I end up delaying things and do something else.


## Consistency

It just occurred to me that what needs fixing isn't the time I wake up. But rather the time that I
sleep.

I already made plans on winding down around 22:45, so I could sleep before midnight.

The plan has been set, and I just need to be consistent with it every single day.


## Randoms

I had my second interview for the year, and it kinda went well. Unfortunately, the position that I
applied to had already been filled, and he just entertained me for a vibe check, and get to
know what I could bring to the table.

I just received an email from my credit card, and it says that it was used in
[recharge.com](https://recharge.com) and around $400 was used! It was a good thing that they had a
fraud detection system and prevented that transaction. And I'm lucky that I'm using credit cards for
online transactions since it would've been hard to reverse that transaction if it was a debit card.


They already blocked the card and sent me a replacement, but I'm still waiting for it to arrive.

I've been enjoying walks lately. I usually do it at night. Today, I went with a walk with my SO for
around 8km. It's a nice way to have a long conversation. You get to spend the day with them, and get
in shape at the same time. Though that might not be the case since we went eating after ðŸ˜†.

I'll probably make walking a routine, but I have to fix my sleeping schedule first.

I kinda want to make this a routine as well where I'd go for a late night walk. I just need to
disconnect from the internet and get my body in shape. It's meant to help me keep being sane.
