## Highlights

* Got offered half of the price agreement we had for the OSS project but it's okay since I'll be
  paid to learn
* I'm still having problems with my sleeping schedule. Can't seem to sleep earlier than 2AM.
* Got my Tonik Bank debit card
* Got to learn more Golang stuffs
* Contemplating on subscribing to GPT-4 or Claude. It's still $20 and I'm still able to utilize the
  free chat they provide
* Got to go out with my SO and walk around :)
* Got to make a simple point system calculator for Beyblade X! It was Chat GPT made but I will
  probably rewrite it in a better framework like Vue.
* Got to layout the flow of my talk about pex files. Just need to do the actual slides. It's only
  gonna be 20 minutes so this shouldn't take long like the first talk I did.

Good luck to the upcoming weeks! I do have to inquire about getting a driving lesson just so I could
get my driver's license and then buy a mini van!
