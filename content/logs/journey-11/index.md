## Motivation

I had been watching Haikyuu for the past week as I just wanted a some sort of refresher before
watching _The Dumpster Battle_.

There were a lot of quotable quotes in the anime.


> Little by little, what you've begun will naturally become important to you.
>
> What you need at the start is a little bit of curiosity.
>
> <cite>Kiyoko Shimizu</cite>


A lot of us could relate to this. You can't say that you don't like something unless you've tried
it. I never knew that I'd like hiking if I never tried it in the first place!


Here's one more quotable quote from one of the best we could learn from:

> I am built upon the small things I do every day, and the end results are no more than a byproduct
> of that.
>
> <cite>Kita Shinsuke</cite>


This just hit me hard. I remember the days when I spent most of my time studying programming.
Trying to understand _for loops_, _nested for loops_, _conditionals_, _functions_, _pointers_,
_OOP_, and other things on how they work and when to use them. There were a lot of frustrations and
sleepless nights, but it eventually led me to where I'm at today. And I'm thankful for myself back
then as he'd prepared and propelled me to this present version of me.

I know I will eventually overcome the phase I'm at right now, but it would take time and
consistency. I want my future self to thank me again for this.


## Reset

I really need this every once in a while. Every after work, I need some sort of reset, ideally a
physical one, where I do exercise after work instead of dozing off just so I could keep my momentum
and eventually finish my day without regrets or procrastinations.


I actually saw this in one of the episodes in Haikyuu (again) where if you are at a point in your
life that you get nervous and in a new place, just look at something familiar, so you could calm
yourself and eventually perform your best.


## Fatigue

After watching the _The Dumpster Battle_, I had an unexpected long walk with my SO as I was
initially just gonna visit her.

When I got home, I wasn't that tired, but my feet hurt as I wasn't wearing a shoe though it was
still a comfortable one.[^1]

I was sneezing heavily, and my nose was kinda inflamed. It was around 2:00, and I slept. I woke up
having a headache and wasn't feeling well.

I rested for the whole day as I couldn't bare staring at the screen, so I wasn't able to do this
journaling last week.
