## Highlights

* Refined my talk around python metaprogramming
  * I didn't expect it to be this complicated for a topic that you aren't going to use 99% of the
    time :/
* Got accepted to be a volunteer for PyCon Mini
  * Want to submit a talk about navigating through a python code base but I'm still hesitant as it
    might not be of "trend"
