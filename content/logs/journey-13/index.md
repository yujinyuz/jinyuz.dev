## DurianPy II


I just attended the second event for DurianPy. Actually, it was on a whim that I decided to attend
just because I had nothing important to do.


The event went well, and I got to connect to new devs.


Oh, I forgot to mention that I was told that I'd be speaking for the next meet up. That got me quite
excited but anxious at the same time since I don't even know if people would want to listen to my
talk.


## Neglected


I actually neglected doing my weekly journal. I guess I didn't have much to say, and I was quite
distracted with my anime re-watch marathons to the point that I neglected doing what I was supposed
to do.
