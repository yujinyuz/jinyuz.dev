## Utterless

I had a message from a recruiter saying that their client was looking for a Senior Python Engineer.
I promptly submitted my updated CV since nothing could go wrong if I applied.

It was my first interview in the last 2 years, so I admit that there probably hasn't been any
improvements in my interviewing skills.

I thought I had prepared, but I guess it wasn't enough. I was rendered speechless when I was asked on
what questions would I ask if there was a client that wanted a ticketing system?


It took me around 1-2 minutes before I could give an answer, and it wasn't really what the recruiter
expected.

I knew what the answer was. It's just that I couldn't spit it out at that point int time.


Oh, well. What's done is done.


## Duties

I attended my sister's White Coating Ceremony last Saturday. It felt new to me as I haven't attended
in ceremonies like this with lots of people.

Nothing much happened, as we just went to a Chinese Restaurant to eat. And I really liked the
dumplings!


After that, we want to a mall and bought myself some new Dri Fit shirts from Uniqlo, new shirt for
my sister, and some Harry Potter merch for my SO's birthday!

My SO had a collaboration with one of the nail salons here in Davao where had her art painted on the
nails. Awesome, right?


## Ricing

I just couldn't get enough of ricing my development workflow. After applying my changes within yabai
and skhd, I started ricing my macOS again with sketchybar.


I felt something was missing with the setup I had before. And this fills in that gap. I wanted to
have a status bar where I could see the desktop I'm at.
