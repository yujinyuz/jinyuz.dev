## Highlights

* Talk about Metaprogramming got accepted and will be presenting on August 23, 2024
* Did my initial preparations for the talk.
  * Somewhat got complicated since I'm not entirely sure how to make it interactive
  * Preparations for a _simple_ talk is not so simple as I thought it would.
* Started going back into meditation. I considered purchasing the Balance app, but it was expensive,
  so I tried looking for alternatives and found Medito. So far so good.
* Noticed I'm already overweight and sometimes having a hard time breathing. I got to start doing
  some exercises like planking and mountain climber just to lose a few pounds. And will start
  dieting as well.
* Learned how to make homemade bean sprouts though I have yet to test if it tastes good.
* Spent some time watching Blade (1998)
* Had an argument with SO about submitting a document without me confirming even though I had
  clearly stated that I should verify the contents first before submitting :facepalm:
  * Infuriating


## New Format


The new format of just using highlights is, I guess, quite better since I can simply list down the
things that happened during this week and probably just add in another section if I want to go into
detail for that topic.
