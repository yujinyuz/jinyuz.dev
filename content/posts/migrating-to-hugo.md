It's been a while since I last posted and one of the reasons was that I was using GatsbyJS and
modified the gatsby-starter-lumen files and it caused me a lot of problems where it came to a point
that my site was not building anymore. I'm probably just inexperienced and might've done something
wrong with the template

I like how `hugo` has this concept of overriding templates by just adding the same `.html` file in
the `layouts` directory.

I really liked the old website design. And also the instant page navigation is one of its killer
features.
I'll probably customize the site in the future.
