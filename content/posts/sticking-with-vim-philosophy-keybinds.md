# Introduction

When was the last time you took quite some time when choosing your vim keybindings? Be it for a
plugin or your own custom functions

I'm gonna talk about the choices I made and what made my keybindings the way it is.


## Getting Started with Vim

When I started out completely moving to (neo)vim from VSCode, I started out copying a bunch of
configs, especially from [leeren](https://github.com/leeren).

His talk about [Going mouseless with Vim and Tmux](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-ZbrtoSuzw) gave
me inspiration to completely switch to vim and with just using less plugins.
